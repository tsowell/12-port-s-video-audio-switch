Source for the AVR microcontroller used in the 12-port S-Video/audio switch.
Processes knob rotation, addresses audio/video multiplexers, and displays a
menu on the VFD screen.

The menu consists of a long horizontal "ribbon" with a logo representing each
input.  Rotating the knob moves the visible portion of the ribbon to the left
and right.  Inputs are configured in stitch.py and must have a corresponding
32-pixel-high PNG in the logos directory.  stitch.py generates ribbon.h which
contains the input configuration and pixel data for the ribbin.  It's called
every time the Makefile runs and stitches the individual PNG files into one
long bitmap in the VFD's pixel format.

The menu also has a special "Info" logo.  When this is selected, a list of
uptimes for the total system and for each input is scrolled vertically on the
display.
