KiCad design, AVR code, and misc CAD files for a 12-port S-Video/audio
switch with VFD display, described in detail here:

The design in the KiCad files has multiple flaws.  Most importantly, the
terminating resistors for the luminance and chroma inputs were omitted, and the
+5VD voltage regualt can become quite hot without a large heatsink.  These are
explained in more detail in the post above.
